        All Audi R8s come with a naturally aspirated V10 engine, which is a rarity in this turbocharged age, and it’s an absolute peach. The standard car comes with 570 horsepower, which is a huge amount in anyone’s book and up 30 horsepower on the previous version of the R8. The engine will soar to very high revs if you want it to, and make a pretty awesome noise while doing it. If you prefer, you can call on the buckets of grunt down low to make your progress. Either way, it’s bonkers fast, but again, it’s impossible to use more than a fraction of its potential on the road without risking your licence.</p>

 <p> Still, if you want even more power – and Audi reckons the majority of customers will – then the Performance cars are tuned to 620 horsepower. That, combined with all-wheel drive and a seven-speed automatic gearbox, takes the 0-62mph time from 3.4 seconds in the standard car to 3.1 seconds, which is really, really fast. The delivery is smooth but such is the force that you’ll be squeezed back in your seat in an intoxicating way.</p>

<p>Audi has also introduced a rear-wheel drive version, called the R8 RWD. We haven’t tried it yet. It has 540 horsepower from the V10. While that’s less than the all-wheel drive cars, having the power going through only one axle should make for an entertaining experience.
