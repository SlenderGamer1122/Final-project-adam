      <p id="hi">Electrons, motors, battery packs, and kilowatts have added a host of new words to the automotive lexicon, but when it comes to the Audi e-tron GT EV, the vocabulary is simple: this thing is fun! A platform mate to the impressive Porsche Taycan, the e-tron GT delivers a calm ride and frenetic acceleration.
        </p>
 <p> With a motor at each axle, the combined output starts at 522 horsepower and rises to as much as 637 in the most powerful RS e-tron GT model. We managed 240 miles of highway range with the RS e-tron GT during testing, which isn’t brag-worthy in a segment that contains the Tesla Model S. The e-Tron GT does offer some compensation for its merely average range thanks to its 270-kW DC fast charger, which makes it one of the quickest charging EVs sold today.</p>

<p>Its standard interior is made from recycled leather-free materials but its low roof and narrow cockpit make getting in and out a challenge for rear-seat riders. Audi’s quickest EV is exciting to drive and great to look at but EVs with more range like the Tesla Model S make a better argument for living with all-electric transportation.
