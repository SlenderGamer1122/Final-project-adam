      <p id="hi">The current generation of the TT has been around for a while, but it remains eye-catching and fun to drive. What it isn’t is a thrill machine for two. It’s available as either a coupe or a convertible and comes with a 228-hp turbocharged four-cylinder engine; the TTS offers a 288-hp version of this engine with significantly more grunt. 
        </p>
 <p>Other sports cars such as the Porsche 718 Cayman and Toyota Supra beat the Audi in terms of outright performance, though even the hotter TTS can’t keep up in terms of acceleration and handling prowess.  </p>

<p> All-wheel drive is standard equipment, as is a dual-clutch automatic transmission but, unfortunately, neither the TT nor TTS are available with a manual transmission—another knock against it in terms of driver engagement.
