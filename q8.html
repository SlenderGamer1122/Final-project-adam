      <p id="hi">We all know someone a little cooler, and in the case of the three-row Audi Q7 SUV it’s the Q8—the more stylish two-row fraternal twin that shares the same underpinnings. The Q8’s proportions are wider, shorter, and lower but the dramatic design sacrifices back-seat headroom, passenger capacity, and cargo area to the Q7 as the Q8 is only offered as a five-seater with two rows
        </p>
 <p> Power comes from a turbocharged 335-hp V-6 engine with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive, the same powertrain as in the Q7’s upper trim levels. The 500-hp SQ8 and even crazier 591-hp RS Q8 are reviewed separately. The joy experienced while driving the Q8 is a benefit of sharing platforms with the Bentley Bentayga and Porsche Cayenne SUVs. The Q8’s chassis balances crisp, reassuring handing with a supple ride.</p>

<p>Even if it's not as athletic as other “SUV coupes” like the BMW X6 or Mercedes-Benz GLE coupe, it’s still enjoyable to drive—and certainly less strange looking. It’s also a cheaper alternative to the A8 full-size luxury sedan by more than $15,000.
