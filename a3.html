      <p id="hi">The 2023 Audi A3 packs a lot of premium content into its compact four-door body, and it also features spry handling and strong performance. As the entry point to the Audi brand, the A3 distills much of the lineup’s tech-focused ethos into a smaller, less expensive package.
        </p>
 <p>It’s a desirable choice among its entry-luxury rivals that include the Acura Integra and the BMW 2-series Gran Coupe. The A3’s cabin is snug but is outfitted with a large infotainment display and a digital gauge cluster, among other luxury and convenience features.  </p>

<p>A 201-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard, and Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system is optional. For those seeking even more thrills in their small luxury car, the more powerful S3 is worth a look; we review that model separately.
